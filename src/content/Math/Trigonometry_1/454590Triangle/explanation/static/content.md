Consider a square split along its diagonal.

We can solve for D using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/RightAngleTriangles/base/Pythagorus',#00756F)).

$$D^2 = A^2 + A^2$$

$$\sqrt{D^2} = \sqrt{2A^2}$$

$$D = \sqrt{2}A$$

The square is split into two right angle triangles where the other two angles of each triangle will be 45ยบ as:

* A triangle's angles [[add to 180ยบ]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)), and we know one angle is 90ยบ.
* They are [[isosceles triangles]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Isosceles/base/Main',#00756F)) and therefore their remaining angles are equal. You could also prove the two angles are equal by showing the two triangles are congruent by [[SSS]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/CongruentTriangles/base/Sss',#00756F)) or [[SAS]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/CongruentTriangles/base/Sas',#00756F)) and therefore are equal halves of the square.
  
Thus we have:

Often the $$A$$ is substituted for a $$1$$:

Any time you come accross a right angle triangle with a 45ยบ angle, you will know the proportion of the sides is $$1$$, $$1$$ and $$\sqrt{2}$$.
