### Example 1

What is the size of angle $$\definecolor{r}{RGB}{238,34,12}\color{r}a$$ in degrees?

![](ex1.png)

<hintLow>[Answer]
The shape is an isosceles triangle, and therefore the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. As we know the angles in a [[triangle]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)) add to 180ยบ, then:

$$180^\circ = \color{r}a \color{black} + \color{r}a \color{black} + 95^\circ$$

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{42.5^\circ}$$
</hintLow>


### Example 2

What is the length of side $$\color{r}a$$?

![](ex2.png)

<hintLow>[Answer]
The triangle has two equal angles, and is therefore an isosceles triangle. As such, the sides opposite the equal angles will be equal in length. Therefore:

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{23}$$
</hintLow>


### Example 3

A square is split with a line between opposite corners. What is angle $$\color{r}a$$ in degrees?

![](ex3.png)

<hintLow>[Answer]
A [[square's]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/RectanglesAndSquares/base/Square',#00756F)) sides are all equal, therefore the triangles that form the split square are isosceles triangles.

We also know the square corner angle is 90ยบ, and so therefore the angle $$\color{r}a$$ is:

$$\color{r}a \color{black} = \frac{180^\circ - 90^\circ}{2} = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{45^\circ}$$
</hintLow>


### Example 4

Show that any triangle made from the diameter of a circle and a point on the circle has the same angle $$\color{r}a$$?

![](ex4.png)

<hintLow>[Answer]

We can use isosceles triangles to solve this problem. Start by considering just one triangle and drawing a line from the point at angle $$\color{r}a$$ to the center of the circle:

![](ex4a.png)

As the circle's radius is a constant length, we have effectively created two isosceles triangles. Each triangle has equal angles $$\definecolor{g}{RGB}{29,177,0}\definecolor{b}{RGB}{0,118,186}\color{b}b$$ and $$\color{g}c$$.

Now sum the original triangle's angles:

$$\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black} = 180^\circ$$

$$2\left (\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black}\right ) = 180^\circ$$

$$\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black}= 90^\circ$$

This answer does not depend on the actual values of $$\color{b}b$$ and $$\color{g}c$$, as it says they will always sum to the same angle.

Therefore, all triangles that have one side as the diameter of the circle, and the other two sides meet at a point on the circle will have an angle opposite the diameter of:

$$\bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{90^\circ}$$

</hintLow>

### Example 5

A $$\color{r}line$$ is drawn between two points of a circle (also called a chord). Show that a triangle formed from this line and any point on the circle on the _same side_ of the line will have the same angle.

![](ex5.png)

<hintLow>[Answer]
Start by considering one triangle, and drawing lines between each of the triangle vertices and the circle center.

![](ex5a.png)

Three isosceles triangles are formed. We can label each of the equal angles, then sum all the angles of the original triangle.

$$\definecolor{v}{RGB}{203,41,123}\left (\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black} \right ) + \left (\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{v}d \color{black} \right ) + \left (\color{g}c \color{black}+ \color{v}d \color{black} \right ) \color{black} = 180^\circ$$

$$\color{b}2b \color{black}+ \color{g}2c + \color{black} + \definecolor{v}{RGB}{203,41,123}\color{v}2d \color{black} = 180^\circ$$

$$\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black} + \color{v}d \color{black} = 90^\circ$$

Angle $$\color{r}a$$ of the triangle is the sum of $$\color{b}b$$ and $$\color{g}c$$:

$$\bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{\color{r}a \color{black}= \color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black} = 90^\circ - \color{v}d}$$

This says $$\color{r}a$$ is **only dependent** on angle $$\color{v}d$$, which stays **constant** at any location of the top point.

_Note:_ If the center of the circle is on the edge of, or outside the triangle, the geometry will look a little different, but the procedure and end result is the same.

</hintLow>

### Example 6

If a triangle is formed on the other side of the chord from Example 5, show that it too will have a constant angle opposite the chord, and show what the relationship is between this angle and the one from Example 5.

<hintLow>[Answer]
You can follow the same procedure from **Example 5** to find the angle. First consider just a single triangle, and draw lines from its vertices to the circle center.

![](ex6a.png)

This creates three isosceles triangles. Now sum all the angles of the original triangle:

$$\left (\color{b}b \color{black}- \color{v}d \color{black} \right ) + \left (\color{b}b \color{black}+ \color{g}c \color{black} \right ) + \left (\color{g}c \color{black}- \color{v}d \color{black} \right ) \color{black} = 180^\circ$$

$$\color{b}2b \color{black}+ \color{g}2c  \color{black} - \color{v}2d \color{black} = 180^\circ$$


$$\bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{\color{b}b \color{black} + \color{g}c \color{black} = 90^\circ + \color{v}d}$$

Once again the angle opposite the chord is constant, depending only on $$\color{v}d$$ which doesn't change for different triangles.

Now, if we add the two angles on either side of the chord together:

$$\left (90^\circ - \color{v}d \color{black} \right ) + \left ( 90^\circ + \color{v}d \color{black} \right)= 180^\circ$$

The sum of the two angles is 180ยบ and they are thus [[supplementary]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/AngleGroups/base/Supplementary',#00756F)).
