## Side Angle Relationship Examples


### Example 1:

#### What is the area of this shape?

![](ex1.png)

The area is the number of squares in the shape. Here we need to be careful as there are a number of half squares to count. Therefore the area is:


$$\bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{25}$$


### Example 2:

#### What is the area of this shape?

![](ex2.png)

The shape is a rectangle, and so its area is the product of its side lengths.

$$area=4 \times 8 = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{32}$$



### Example 3:

#### What is the area of this shape?

![](ex3.png)

The shape is a square, and so its area is the square of its side length.

$$area=5 \times 5 = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{25}$$


### Example 4:

#### What is the total area of these shapes?

![](ex4.png)

The total shape consists of a rectangle of $$15 \times 8$$ and a square of $$10 \times 10$$. Therefore, the area is the sum of both:

$$area=120 + 100 = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{200}$$


### Example 5:

#### What is the side length of this square?

![](ex5.png)

The area of a square is the square of the side length, therefore, therefore the side length will be the square root of the area.

$$side\ \ length=\sqrt{16} = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{4}$$


### Example 6:

#### What is the area of one of the triangles?

![](ex6.png)

Counting the squares is a little challenging as there are lots of portions of squares. However, we might notice a pattern that helps with our calculation.

Each triangle seems to have the same corresponding square portions. Some examples are colored below:

If we do a sum of all portions of squares in each triangle we see they are the same.

Therefore, the area is half the area of the larger rectangle:

$$area= \textstyle\frac{1}{2} 5 \times 8 = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{20}$$
