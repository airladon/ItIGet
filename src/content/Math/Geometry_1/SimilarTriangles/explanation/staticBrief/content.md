## Similar Triangles

**Similar** shapes are those that have the same shape but are a different size.

**Similar** triangles have the same corresponding angles and their corresponding sides are the same proportion.


### Equiangular Triangles are Similar - Proof

Consider two triangles with **equal angles** overlaid on each other.

$$\angle DBC$$ and $$\angle ADE$$ are [[equal corresponding angles]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/AnglesAtIntersections/base/Corresponding',#00756F)), therefore $$\color{b}BC \parallel DE$$.

When a triangle is [[split with a parallel line]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/ParallelSplitOfTriangle/base/Triangle',#00756F)), the smaller triangle's sides will all be scaled by the same proportion.

Therefore $$\triangle ABC$$ and $$\triangle ADE$$ are **similar**.


*Triangles with the same corresponding angles will have corresponding sides of equal proportion, and will therefore be similar.*


### Similar Triangles are Equiangular - Proof

Start with two triangles whose **corresponding sides have equal proportion**.

Start by drawing the two proportional triangles $$\triangle ABC$$ and $$\triangle DEF$$, and then draw an additional triangle along $$DF$$ with the angles $$\angle BAC=\angle GDF$$ and $$\angle ACB=\angle DFG$$:

Angles in a triangle [[add]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)) to 180ยบ, so two triangles with the same two angles will have the same third angle: $$\color{b}\angle ABC = \angle DGF$$

Therefore all the corresponding angles of $$\triangle ABC$$ and $$\triangle DFG$$ are equal.

From above, two triangles with the same corresponding angles are similar.

Therefore:

$$\color{b} \frac{DG}{AB} = \frac{DF}{AC} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \color{grey}(1)$$

We started with:

$$\color{b} \frac{\color{r}{DE}\color{b}}{AB} = \frac{DF}{AC} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \color{grey}(2)$$

Combining $$\color{grey}(1)$$ and $$\color{grey}(2)$$:

$$\color{b} DE = DG$$

Using the same process, can similarly show:

$$\color{b} EF = GF$$

Triangles with the same side lengths are [[congruent]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/CongruentTriangles/base/Sss',#00756F)), so the angles of $$\triangle DEF$$ will be equal to the angles in $$\triangle DFG$$ and therefore $$\triangle ABC$$.

Therefore $$\triangle ABC$$ and $$\triangle DEF$$ are similar as they have the same angles, and their corresponding sides have the same proportion.
