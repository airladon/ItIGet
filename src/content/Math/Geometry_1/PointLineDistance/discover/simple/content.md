The distance between a point and a line is defined as the minimum distance between the two.

When the point is off the end of the line, then the minimum distance is between the point and the end of the line.

However, when the point is over the line, where on the line is the minimum distance?

<hint>[Hint 1]Draw a line between the point and the line, that has some angle. Is there an angle that will guarantee you have the minimum distance?</hint>


<hintLow>[Hint 2]What if the angle is a right angle? Can you prove there are no other lines at other angles that are shorter?

<hintLow>[Hint 3] Remember the [[hypotenuse]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/RightAngleTriangles/base/Definition',#00756F)) of a right angle triangle is always the longest side in a right angle triangle.

<hintLow>[Answer]

A right angle triangle can be drawn between the point and the line of interest.

The triangle side that is perpendicular to the line will always be shorter than the hypotenuse, as the hypotenuse is [[always]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/RightAngleTriangles/base/Definition',#00756F)) the longest side in a right angle triangle.

Any line you draw from the point to the line that is not the perpendicular line will be the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle, and thus the perpendicular line must be the shortest.
