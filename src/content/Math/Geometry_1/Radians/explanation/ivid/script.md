Welcome to this interactive video on the radian and why we use it.

This is interactive, so if you see me interacting with an element on the screen then you can too. When you do so the video will pause so just press play to continue when you’re ready.

# 1
A Radian is a measure of angle, which we normally first learn how to measure using degrees.

# 2
Splitting the circle into 360 pieces is very convenient as 360 has many factors and therefore many fractions of a circle can be expressed with whole numbers. ￼ this makes adding, subtracting and diving portions of a circle easy to do without a calculator. And so degrees has an every day, PRACTICAL convenience.

In comparison, a radian RELATES PROPERTIES for MATHEMATICAL convenience.

# 3, 4
A radian is defined as the angle where the circle’s arc length equals the radius.

# 5
This means an arc of two radians has a length of 2 radius lengths, and an arc of 0.5 radians has a length of half the radius.

# 6, 7,
We can rewrite this as a mathematical expression by generalizing the number of radians as “angle”.

# 8
And so using angle as radians lets us use this simple relationship, which we can then use to find some interesting implications.

# 9, 10, 11, 12
First let’s use it to find the number of radians in a full circle, by remembering the arc length of a full circle is the circumference, which is 2πr. These expressions are the same, and so there must be 2π radians in a circle.

<!-- # 13
Next, let’s rearrange the relationship for the angle. Now, as both arc length and radius are a measure of length, this tells us that angle is a ratio, or unitless quantity, and we just use symbols like degrees or  radians to signify the denominator of the ratio. 90 degrees is 90 360ths of a circle, and 2 radians is 2 /2π of a circle. -->

# 13, 14, 15
In addition, looking at the relationship helps us understand that the arc length is really just the angle scaled by the radius. Therefore, in the special case where the radius is 1, the arc length and angle are the same.

This simplifies problems considerably, and as a result radians and unit circles, or circles with radius 1, are often used to find the solutions problems involving circles, arcs or rotations.

So what we have so far is:
* A radian is the angle where the arc length and radius length are equal
* There are 2π radians in a circle
* Using radians allows us relate arc length, radius length and angle directly

Both radians and degrees are useful in different areas, and so we need to know how to convert between radians and degrees. We can do this by understanding that an angle in degrees and radians is actually expressing the same portion of a circle.

We can then rearrange this equation to find the scaling factor to convert radians to degrees, and similarly the factor to convert degrees to radians.

We can now use our knowledge of radians to understand why they are used almost exclusively in mathematics, science and engineering.

As an example, consider an arc of a unit circle produced by some angle x, and the vertical component of the arc. The vertical component changes with angle, and so is a function of x, which we call the sine function.

As the radius is 1, the arc length has the same value as the angle itself, and is therefore x.

Now if we look at the length of the vertical component, and the arc, we see that as the angle decreases, they become more similar.

This is expressed mathematically as a limit. As x approaches 0, then as the vertical component and the arc length become more similar, then their ratio is equal to 1.

Now the x in the expression can also be angle, and so this can be interpreted as the vertical component of an angle, and the angle effectively are the same at small angles.

This is a tremendously useful relationship, and is used in many proofs showing other relationships. For instance, in calculus, you can use it to show the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function, and then from that show that the sine function can be expressed as an infinite series.

Now what happens when we use degrees? Well, the starting relationship between angle, arc length and radius becomes a little more complicated with an extra term.

This extra term cascades and as a result, the infinite series is polluted with extra terms.

So radians keeps the mathematics simple and intuitive. Less unnecessary terms reduces mistakes, speeds solutions and makes it is easier to think about a relationship and its implications. In other words, radians is a more natural and elegant way to express angles in mathematics, and so is used almost exclusively.
