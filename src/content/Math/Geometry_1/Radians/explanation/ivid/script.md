Welcome to this interactive video on the radian and why we use it.

This is interactive, so if you see me interacting with an element on the screen then you can too. When you do so the video will pause so just press play to continue when you’re ready.

# 1
A Radian is a measure of angle, but often we first learn how to measure angle with degrees.

# 2
Splitting the circle into 360 pieces is quite convenient as 360 has many factors and therefore many fractions of a circle can be expressed with whole numbers. ￼ This makes adding, subtracting and dividing portions of a circle easy to do without a calculator.

# 3
And so we can say degrees has an every day, ARITHEMETICAL or PRACTICAL convenience.

In comparison, measuring angles in radians provides a deeper, mathematical convenience, as it can be used to EXPRESS MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS between angles and circles more naturally.

# 3
So let's see what that means by using an angle to form an arc.

# 3, 4
A radian is defined as the angle where the circle’s arc length equals the radius.

# 5
So if an angle of 1 radian creates an arc of 1 radius length, then an angle of two radians must create an arc of 2 radius lengths, and 3 radians create an arc of 3 radius lengths and so on.

# 6, 7,
This means we can rewrite this as a mathematical expression by generalizing the number of radians as “angle”.

# 8
And so we have a simple relationship between arc length, angle and radius.

For starters, this is useful because it means we can rearrange this relationship to find an unknown property.

# 9, 10, 11, 12
But we can also use it to figure out how many radians there must be in a full circle, by remembering the arc length of a full circle is the circumference, which is 2πr. These two expressions are the same, and so there must be 2π radians in a circle.

<!-- # 13
Next, let’s rearrange the relationship for the angle. Now, as both arc length and radius are a measure of length, this tells us that angle is a ratio, or unitless quantity, and we just use symbols like degrees or  radians to signify the denominator of the ratio. 90 degrees is 90 360ths of a circle, and 2 radians is 2 /2π of a circle. -->

# 13, 14, 15
Next, we can look at the relationship and see the arc length is really just the angle scaled by the radius. Therefore, in the special case where the radius is 1, the arc length and angle are the same.

This simplifies problems considerably, and as a result radians and circles with radius 1 (also called unit circles), are often used to find the solutions problems to involving circles, arcs or rotations.

# 16, 17, 18
So what we have so far is:
* A radian is the angle where the arc length and radius length are equal
* There are 2π radians in a circle
* Using radians allows us relate arc length, radius length and angle directly

# 19, 20
Both as radians and degrees are useful in different areas, we need to know how to convert between them. We can do this by understanding that an angle in degrees and radians is actually expressing the same portion of a circle.

We can now rearrange this equation and find the scaling factor that converts radians to degrees, and similarly the factor to convert degrees to radians.

And using this, we will be able to see why radians are used almost exclusively in mathematics, science and engineering.

# 21

If degrees and radians are interchangable with a scaling factor, it means we can express our relationship between arc length, angle and radius in degrees - and we see it has an extra term.

By itself, this doesn't seem that complicated, but as this is a foundational relationship used in many places, it can quickly become unmanageable. 

# 21, 22, 23,
As an example, consider an arc of a unit circle produced by some angle x, and the vertical component of the arc. The length of the vertical component changes with angle, and so is a function of x, which we call the sine function.

# 24
As a final piece of our setup, we can reconize the arc length has the same value as the angle because the radius is 1, and so the arc length is x.

Playing with this, we can observe that as the angle x decreases, then the arc length and the vertical component length become more similar.

<!-- Now if we look at the length of the vertical component, and the arc, we see that as the angle decreases, they become more similar. -->

# 25
This is expressed mathematically as a limit. As x approaches 0, then the vertical component and the arc length become more similar, and their ratio approaches 1.

Now this x of course, is both the arc length, and the angle - so we can also interpret this as saying angle and the length of the vertical component effectively have the same value at small angles.
<!-- 
Now the x in the expression can also be angle, and so this can also be interpreted as the vertical component of the angle, and the angle effectively are the same at small angles. -->

This is a tremendously useful relationship, and is used as a simplification in many proofs showing other relationships.

# 26, 27
For instance, in calculus, you can use it to show the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function, and then from that show that the sine function can be expressed as an infinite series.

# 28
Now what happens when we use degrees? Well, that extra term we saw in the initial relationship between arc length, angle and radius has cascaded and as a result, the infinite series is polluted with extra terms.

# 29
So radians keeps the mathematics simple and intuitive. Less unnecessary terms reduces mistakes, speeds solutions and makes it is easier to think about a relationship and its implications. In other words, radians is a more simple and natural way to express angles in mathematics, and so is used almost exclusively.

# 30
Finally, having covered what a radian is, and why we use it, let's end by getting a FEEL for them. This table directly compares some common angles in radians and degrees.

As π is irrational, the most common, precisce and concise way to express angles in radians is as a fraction of π. However, there are areas, such as in software development, where you must use the value of radians directly, and it is convenient to be familiar with the value of some common angles.
