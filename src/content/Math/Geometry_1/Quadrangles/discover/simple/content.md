## Four sided Shapes

A **quadrangle** is a shape with four sides and four angles. It is also sometimes called a **quadrilateral**.

The word **quadrangle** comes from the latin words _quattuor_ which is _"four"_ and _angulus_ which is _"angle, corner"_.

Similarly **quadrilateral** comes from the latin words _quattuor_ and _latus, later_ which is _"side"_.


## Total Internal Angle

Similar to how a [[triangle's]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)) angles always sum to 180ยบ, a quadrangle's angles also always add to the same angle.

Can you prove what that angle is?

<hintLow>[Answer]
  Any quadrangle can be split into two triangles.

  Each triangle has a total internal angle of 180ยบ, and so the quadrangle is 360ยบ.
