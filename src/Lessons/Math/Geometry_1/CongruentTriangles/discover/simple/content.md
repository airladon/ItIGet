### Congruent Triangles

In mathematics, if **two shapes are the same size and shape**, then they are said to be **congruent**.

The word **congruent** comes from _Latin_, where it means _"agreeing, meeting together"_.

For two triangles to be **congruent**, the corresponding **side lengths** and **angles** of each triangle must be the same as the other.

Flipped and rotated triangles can still have the same corresponding sides and angles and therefore be congruent.

### Congruency Tests

The easy way to determine if two triangles are congruent is to measure all their sides and angles.

But is there a faster way? What is the number of sides and/or angles you need to know to determine if two triangles are congruent?

#### 1 Property

If you just know a single side or angle, is that enough to know whether two triangles are congruent?

Another way to ask this is: if you fix one side (or angle), how many different triangles can you make?

If the answer is just one, then you know if two triangles have one side that is the same length then they will be congruent.
