## Side Angle Relationship of a Triangle

If you draw many different triangles with angles that are both large and small, you might start to see a relationship between the opposite sides and angles. Can you see it?

<hintLow>
Here are several triangles:

<hint>Which is the largest angle and side? Which is the smallest?</hint>

<hintLow>[Answer]
The side opposite the largest angle is always longest, while the side opposite the smallest angle is always the shortest.
</hintLow>

Can you prove this?

<hintLow>Start with a triangle where one side is clearly longer than the other and mark the opposite angles

<hintLow>Draw an isosceles triangle along sides A and B such that the equal sides equal A
