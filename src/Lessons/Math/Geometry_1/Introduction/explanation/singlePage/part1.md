|Mathematics is a powerful tool|. We use to |understand| and |predict| the world around us.

Mathematics describes something like an object, path or phenomenon in a more |simple|, and more |general| way. Describing something more |simply|, makes it easier to study and understand. Describing something more |generally|, means the understanding can be reapplied to other scenarios.

When an object is described in a more simple and general way, its main features are highlighted. The essence of the object is |drawn away| from its complexity. We use the word |abstract| to describe the action of drawing the essence from an object and creating a more simple, general description of it. The word |abstract| comes from the Latin word |abstractus| which means "drawn away". Thus, to simplify and generalize an object is to |abstract| an object, and something which is simplified and generalized is an |abstraction| of that object.

A large area of mathematics is the study of |shapes|. Shapes are simple abstractions of |objects|, |phenomena| and the |paths| they travel.

For example, a |wheel| is a physical thing. It is made of different materials, has mass, size, location and smell. A wheel can be abstracted into a |shape| by focusing just on its outline, and removing a lot of the details of how it is made.
