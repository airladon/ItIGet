## Calculating Circle Properties using Radians

When angle is measured in Radians, the relationship between arc length, radius and angle is:

$$\definecolor{b}{RGB}{0,118,186}\definecolor{r}{RGB}{238,34,12}\definecolor{g}{RGB}{1,113,0} \color{r}arc length \color{black}= 2 \times \color{g}angle \color{black}= 2 \times \color{b}radius$$

To convert angle between degrees and radians use:

$$degrees = \frac{180}{\pi} \times radians$$
$$radians = \frac{\pi}{180} \times degrees$$

### Example 1:

#### What is the arc length that has a radius of 2, and an angle of 1 radian?

$$\color{r}arc length \color{black}=2 \times 1 = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{2}$$

### Example 2:

#### What is the radius of an arc with length 2, and angle 0.5?

First rearrange the relationship between arc length, radius and angle:

$$\color{r}radius \color{black} = \frac{\color{r}arc length}{\color{g}angle}$$
