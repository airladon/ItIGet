## Right Angle Triangles

### Definition

A triangle that has a right angle, is a **Right Angle Triangle**.

The side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**.

The word _hypotenuse_ comes from the Greek word _hypoteinousa_ which means “stretching under”. Therefore the **hypotenuse is the side stretching under the right angle**.

The hypotenuse is always the longest side in a triangle. Can you show why this is?

<hint>Use the [[side angle relationship]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/SideAngleRelationship/base/Main',#00756F))  of a triangle</hint>

<hintLow>[Answer]
A triangle's [[total angle]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)) is always 180º. Therefore, if one angle is 90º, it must be the largest angle.

We also know that the longest side is [[always opposite the largest angle]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/SideAngleRelationship/base/Main',#00756F)) in a triangle. Therefore, the hypotenuse, which is opposite the right angle, is always the longest.

Here are several triangles:
