## External Angles of a Triangle Calculations


### Example 1:

#### What is the length of side $$\definecolor{r}{RGB}{238,34,12}\color{r}a$$?

![](ex1.png)

The shape is a rectangle, and rectangles have equal and opposite sides. Therefore:

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{10}$$


### Example 2:

#### What is the length of side $$\color{r}a$$?

We are given that the opposite sides of the shape are parallel. We also know that [[interior]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/AnglesAtIntersections/base/Interior',#00756F)) angles of a line intersecting two parallel lines add to 180ยบ.

If you apply the interior angles knowledge to the two vertical parallel lines, and then to the two horizontal parallel lines you can show all angles in the shape are right angles.

Therefore, the shape is a rectangle, and we know that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. Therefore

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{2}$$



### Example 3:

#### What is the size of angle $$\color{r}a$$ in degrees?

The quadrangle shape has an unknown angle $$\color{r}c$$. As we know internal angles in a [[quadrangle]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Quadrangles/base/Main',#00756F))  add to 360ยบ, then we can calculate this to be: 

$$\color{r}c \color{black}= 360^\circ - 90^\circ - 90^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ$$

Thus we now now the quadrangle is a rectangle.

As the rectangle has opposite parallel sides, then the given angle and angle $$\color{r}b$$ are equal [[corresponding]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/AnglesAtIntersections/base/Corresponding',#00756F)) angles.

$$\color{r}b \color{black}= 100^\circ$$

Finally, angles $$\color{r}b$$ and $$\color{r}a$$ are [[supplementary]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/AngleGroups/base/Supplementary',#00756F)):

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= 180^\circ - 100^\circ = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{80^\circ}$$
