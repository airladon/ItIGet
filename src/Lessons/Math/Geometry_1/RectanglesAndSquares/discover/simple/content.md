## Rectangle

A special type of [[quadrangle]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Quadrangles/base/Main',#00756F)) is one where all the angles are **90ยบ**. This shape is called a **rectangle**.

The word **rectangle** comes from the latin words _rectus_ which is _"right"_ and _angulus_ which is _"angle, corner"_.

## Side Relationships

A rectangle's opposite sides are parallel and equal. Can you prove this?

<hint>First prove they are parallel</hint>

<hint>To show they are parallel, use [[interior]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/AnglesAtIntersections/base/Interior',#00756F)) angles</hint>

<!-- Similar to how a [[triangle's]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)) angles always sum to 180ยบ, a quadrangle's angles also always add to the same angle. -->

<!-- Can you prove what that angle is?

<hint>Try splitting the quadrangle into triangles</hint>

<hintLow>[Answer]
  Any quadrangle can be split into two triangles.

  Each triangle has a total internal angle of 180ยบ, and so the quadrangle is 360ยบ.
