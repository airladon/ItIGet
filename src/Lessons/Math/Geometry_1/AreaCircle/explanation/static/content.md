## Area of a Circle

Finding the area of a circle can seem challening at first as area is measured in squares and squares don't easily fit into circles.

Start with a **Right Angled Triangle** that has side lengths $$\definecolor{lessonBlue}{RGB}{0,162,255}\definecolor{lessonGreen}{RGB}{29,177,0}\color{lessonBlue}A$$, $$\color{lessonBlue}{B}$$, and $$\color{lessonBlue}{C}$$, and angles $$\color{lessonGreen}{a}$$, $$\color{lessonGreen}{b}$$ and $$\color{lessonGreen}{90^\circ}$$:

As a triangle's angles add to 180ยบ, and one angle is $$\color{lessonGreen}{90^\circ}$$, then the remaining angles must be $$\color{lessonGreen}{180^\circ-90^\circ = 90^\circ}$$.
