## Equilateral Triangle Calculation Examples

<!-- 
### Example 1:

#### What is the size of angle $$\definecolor{r}{RGB}{238,34,12}\color{r}a$$ in degrees?

The shape is an isosceles triangle, and therefore the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. As we know the angles in a [[triangle]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/Triangles/base/AngleSum',#00756F)) add to 180ยบ, then:

$$180^\circ = \color{r}a \color{black} + \color{r}a \color{black} + 95^\circ$$

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{42.5^\circ}$$



### Example 2:

#### What is the length of side $$\color{r}a$$?

![](ex2.png)

The triangle has two equal angles, and is therefore an isosceles triangle. As such, the sides opposite the equal angles will be equal in length. Therefore:

$$\color{r}a \color{black}= \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{23}$$



### Example 3:

#### A square is split with a line between opposite corners. What is angle $$\definecolor{r}{RGB}{238,34,12}\color{r}a$$ in degrees?

![](ex3.png)

A [[square's]]((qr,'Math/Geometry_1/RectanglesAndSquares/base/Square',#00756F)) sides are all equal, therefore the triangles that form the split square are isosceles triangles.

We also know the square corner angle is 90ยบ, and so therefore the angle $$\color{r}a$$ is:

$$\color{r}a \color{black} = \frac{180^\circ - 90^\circ}{2} = \bbox[10px,border:1px solid gray]{45^\circ}$$
