## Learning
There are many ways to learn.

People’s individual experiences, knowledge, language, context and personality mean different ways work better different people.

How the learning is to be applied also changes which way might be most effective. Sometimes practice is the most efficient or most appropriate way to learn, other times having a deep understanding is required.

Even time can play a role. As someone becomes a more experienced learner, their preference for how they learn may evolve.

So what are the different ways to learn? One way to categorize them is by approach, style and participation.

Some examples of different learning approaches are:

* by discovery - knowing about a problem, and being challenged to come up with a concept to understand it better, or a tool to solve it
* by explanation - a description of what and why something is
* by example - seeing when and how something is used
* by practice - using that thing repeatedly
* or by a combination of ways

Each of these approaches can be delivered in different styles. For example an explanation might be:

* precise or intuitive
* brief or descriptive
* general or personalized
* visual or text based
* interactive or static
* or a combination of styles

And then there are different ways to participate in the learning, such as:

* in person
* from media such as text and videos
* as part of a group working toward a project or goal
* or a combination of ways

So there are many ways to learn, and no one place or person can do everything for everyone.

In the end, learning is successful if you get what you need out of it.


## This I Get's Contribution

There has never before been more resources and opportunities available for someone who wants to learn.

But as a learner, how do you decide where to spend time learning? Time is a finite resource. The more efficiently you learn, the sooner you can use those learnings.

Similarly from the teacher's perspective, how do you decide how to teach? What assumptions do you make about your learner? For whom do those assumptions not apply?

So instead of selecting a particular way to learn, this site tries to embrace many of the diverse possibilities. It does this through:

* Having multiple versions of the same content, covering different approaches and styles
* Allowing users to rate which versions of the content work best for them
* Embracing external content and allowing users to rate it

In the short term, having multiple approaches, styles and external links describing the same content in different ways will hopefully be a useful resource. Rating the content might be valuable to a learner so if they review it again, they know what they connected with best.

In the longer term as more content is rated, users may be able to get a more personalized and efficient experience by having content that is more likely to resonate with them presented first.

## This site

Many sources of information such as textbooks, videos and websites will present content in one way particular to that source. If the content is not clear for a learner, it is up to them to search for other sources of the same information that might be more useful.

In contrast, this site tries to present several versions of the same content to a learner, including links to external sources of similar information. Each version of content and external link can be rated by the learners. The hope is learners will more quickly find a version of content that works for them, allowing them to learn more efficiently.

This page highlights the site's features as a way to introduce what the site is and how to use it.

## Typical Content

Below is a screenshot of a typical page on this site with some areas labeled.

![](example.png)

### Topic
A “Topic” is the site’s fundamental unit, and represents a piece of knowledge, a concept or procedure. It has associated "Content" that describes or explores the topic. The knowledge required to understand a topic, and the desired learnings from having reviewed the topic's content should be well defined.

In the diagram above, the selected topic is titled "Angles at Intersections". This topic covers the geometric concepts of opposite, corresponding, alternate and interior angles. It requires the knowledge of the "Parallel Lines" topic (and other topics before it), and leads to understanding the "Triangles" topic.

### Learning Approach:
Different approaches can be used to cover the topic's content. Most commonly, these approaches are:

* Discover - a problem statement is given with progressively more hints to allow the user to discover the topic
* Explanation - a complete description of the topic
* Summary - key concepts or knowledge the topic covers
* Examples - examples showing where and how to use the topic
* Quiz - practice using the topic's concepts and knowledge
* TA - interactive diagrams that might be useful in a teaching environment
* Links - a selection of external links that address the same topic content in different ways or from different perspectives

### Content Version:

There are several ways to describe or present content using the same approach. For instance, an "Explanation" might:

* be described more precisely, or more intuitively
* be described more concisely, or descriptively
* have interactive content or be completely static
* be presented as video, audio, presentation slides or text
* use one line of reasoning or proof, instead of another
* completely cover the topic, or focus on just one area

An example of different versions is below. In this case the topic "Right Angle Triangles" has an "Explanation" with two different versions: "Full Explanation" and "Derivation of Pythagorean Theorm". In this case, the first version covers the entire topic, while the second version focuses on just a portion of the topic.

### Rating:
Each version of content and external link, can be rated by a learner between 1 and 5. The learner can use their own judgement when rating content, but one way might be:
* 5 - The content really resonates with the learner from start to finish
* 4 - The content is well done, but there a few areas that weren’t clear
* 3 - The content is good, but other versions were needed to fully get it
* 2 - The content is difficult to understand, and doesn’t really work for the learner
* 1 - The content was not helpful

Ratings are personal. A version of content may get a 5 from some learners, and a 1 from others. Even if content only gets high ratings from a small percentage of learners, it is still valuable and appreciated. The fact it helped some people is fantastic, as other more popular versions of the content might not have been as helpful for them.

Learners can see two ratings for each version of content:
* Their own rating
* The number of people that gave a rating of 4 or 5

The intent here is to celebrate all versions that help learners, and not degrade from those that help only a small percentage.

Whether this can be realized is not clear, and this will likely be experimented with over time.

### Learning Path:
A learning path is a set of topics that follow each other based on the dependence of their content.

A set of knowledge is assumed for the first topic at the start of the path. But after that point, each topic covers all knowledge that future topics in the path will require.


## Content Format

There are several ways content is currently formatted on the site.

### Presentation Format

The presentation format allows:
* Gradual introduction of content
* Interactive diagrams
* Equation animation that can show clear progression through equation forms

An example of presentation format is below. Arrows to the side or beneath the content allow for slide to slide navigation. Touching the slide number allows jumping between sections.

Some of the presentation content versions are interactive. Generally text that is bold can be touched that will result in an acation, and sometimes the diagram itself can be manipulated.

Repeated touching of the "Interactive Hint Button" will highlight all the interactive elements on the current slide.

### Single Page Format

The single page format shows all content in a single, scrollable page.

Content is generally not interactive, but some text may be clickable as links or as quick references to other topics.
