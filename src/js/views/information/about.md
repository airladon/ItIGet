# About This I Get

## Goal

Be inclusive.

## Learning
There are many ways to learn.

Peopleâ€™s individual experiences, knowledge, language, context and personality mean some ways work better for some people and other ways work better for others.

How the learning is to be applied also changes which way might be most effective. Sometimes practice is the most efficient or most appropriate way to learn, other times having a deep understanding is required.

Even time can play a role. As someone becomes a more experienced learner, their preference for how they learn may evolve.

Some examples of the different ways to learn include:

* by discovery - knowing about a problem, and being challenged to come up with a concept to understand it better, or a tool to solve it
* by explanation - a description of what and why something is
* by example - seeing when and how something is used
* by practice - using that thing repeatedly
* or by a combination of ways

Each of these ways can be delivered in different styles. For example an explanation might be:

* precise or intuitive
* brief or descriptive
* general or personalized
* or a combination of styles

And then there are different ways to participate in the learning, such as:

* in person
* or from media such as text and videos
* or as part of a group working toward a project or goal

So there are many ways to learn, and no one place or person can do everything for everyone.

In the end, learning is successful if you get what you need out of it.


## This I Get's Contribution

There has never before been more resources and opportunities available for someone who wants to learn.

But as a learner, how do you decide where to spend time learning? Time is a finite resource. The more efficiently you learn, the sooner you can use those learnings.

As a teacher, how do you decide how to teach? What assumptions do you make about your learner? For whom do those assumptions not apply?

So instead of selecting a particular approach, this site tries to embrace many of the diverse possibilities. It does this through:

* Having multiple approaches and versions of the same content
* Allowing users to rate which approaches and versions of content work best for them
* Embracing external content and allowing users to rate it

In the short term, having multiple approaches, versions and external links describing the same content in different ways will hopefully be a useful resource. Rating the content might be valuable to a learner so if they review it again, they know what they connected with best.

In the longer term as more content is rated, users may be able to get a more personalized and efficient experience by having content that is more likely to resonate with them presented first.
