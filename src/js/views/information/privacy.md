## How is data used? <a name="howisdataused"></a>

No personal data collected by the website is sold to or shared with third parties unless legally required to do so.

The aggregate number of users or users with accounts may be shared publically for the purpose of marketing this website.


### Log Data

Log Data is used for website management and optimization. For example fixing problems with the website, ensuring content is compatible with browsers, and understanding traffic patterns to optimize content delivery.

### Account Data

This data is used for account management, such as resetting your password and is also used as a unique identifier to tie your ratings to your account so you can review them in the future.

### Account Usage Data

Sign-up and login times are used for understanding number of active users on the website, to help optimize performance and content.

Rating data is stored so you can retrieve it later to review which content you preferred, and also collated with all other user's ratings to make statistical rating summaries for the website content.

Ratings summaries can be seen by all users, but are anonymous and no users can see what you have rated.

## How is data stored? <a name="howisdatastored"></a>

Data is stored in servers in the United States of America.

All data that is transmitted between your browser and this website's servers is encrypted (SSL), and all data you provide that is potentially identifiable is obfuscated and/or encrypted.

While this website strives for industry standard security practices, no security system is perfect. Therefore it is recommended when you do provide information such as your username, password and email address when creating an account, you choose a username that is not linked to your identity, a password that is randomly generated and managed by a password management system, and an email address that is not linked to your identity and is secured with a robust password and two-factor authentication.

This website will never send you an email asking for your password, or any personal information, and if you see any such thing then you should contact us at privacy@thisiget.com.

### Log Data

Log data is stored as plain text logs on the website server.

### Account Data

Passwords you enter are never stored directly. Instead, they are converted to a unique set of characters (called a "hash") that can be used in the future to verify the correct password is entered, but cannot be used to determine the original password. The hash is additionally secured through encryption and other security processes detailed in the [data security policy]().

Usernames and Email Addresses are stored in two forms:

* ecrypted text - allows the website to use the original text. For example, the website will show your username when you are logged in, or send you an email if you forgot your password.
* encrypted hash - allows the website to check any new accounts are using unique usernames and email addresses efficiently


### Account Usage Data

Rating, login and signup data is stored in plain text in a database on the database server.
