## Summary <a name="summary"></a>

There are two types of users for this website

* Registered users - users who have created an account with www.thisiget.com and are logged in
* Anonymous users - users without an account, or, who have an account but are not logged in

All users (registered and anonymous) can access all learning content on this website. When using the website, data provided by the browser such as browser type and version, IP address and sometimes the type of device the browser is on is collected by the website to understand and optimize website use and performance.

If a user wants to rate content, then an account needs to be created, and the user needs to be logged into the account (registered user). A registered user needs to provide a unique username, a password and a valid email address. When logged into an account, data such as login time, content ratings and rating times are collected. This data is collected for

* Future reference to the user - they can see what they have liked and what they haven’t
* Anonymous aggregation for rating summaries shown to all users
* As analytics to understand how many active users there are for website optimization and performance

Usernames, email addresses and passwords are never stored directly. Instead, they are stored with a combination of encryption and hashing (a one-way process that converts characters like a password into a unique set of different characters from which the password cannot be extracted). For more information on how data is stored securely, see [security]().

### Log Data

Log data is stored as plain text logs on the website server.

### Account Data

Passwords you enter are never stored. Instead, they are converted to a unique set of characters (called a "hash") that can be used to verify in the future the correct password is entered, but cannot be used to determine the original password. The hash is additionally secured through encryption and other security processes detailed in the [data security policy]().

Usernames and Email Addresses are stored in two forms:

* ecrypted text - allows the website to use the original text. For example, the website will show your username when you are logged in, or send you an email if you forgot your password.
