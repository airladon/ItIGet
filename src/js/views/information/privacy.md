## Why We Need to Collect and Process Data <a name="why"></a>

Our philosophy is to collect the minimum amount of data needed to provide our Services, only use that data to provide our services, and restrict sharing that data with third parties unless absolutely necessary. We need to collect and process data, so that:

* Users are able to create accounts, rate Content and have a history of their ratings.
* To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.
* To detect, prevent and address technical issues.
* To provide user support.
* We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

## What Data is Collected <a name="whatdata"></a>

We collect information you provide directly to us, when you contact us, contribute to this Website with Content, or otherwise communicate with us.

### Data Collected From You – Account Data

When you create an account on this Website we require and collect personally identifiable information that includes a valid username of your choice, date of birth, an email address, and a password (“Personal Information”). You provide this directly to us in the account creation process. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen.

Anonymized, aggregated statistics of users and Content ratings may be shared publicly for the purpose of marketing this website.

### Communication Data

Any information or data you submit to us when you communicate with us is used to complete our communication, execute a requested action, and may be used to improve or update the Services.

### Account Data

This data is used for account management, such as resetting your password. It is also used as a unique identifier to link your ratings to your account so only you can review and change them in the future.

### Account Usage Data

Sign-up and login times are used for understanding the number of active users on the Website, to help optimize performance and content.

Content rating data is stored so you can retrieve it later to review or update.

Content rating data is also aggregated with all other user's ratings to produce statistical summaries. These summaries can be seen by all users, but are anonymous and no users can see your individual ratings.

### Log Data

Log Data is used by This I Get for Website management and optimization. For example, fixing problems with the Website, ensuring the Website is compatible with different browsers, and understanding traffic patterns to optimize Content delivery.

### Service Providers

We use third party service providers to help provide our Services, for example companies that provide the servers where we host this website and global content delivery networks that speed access to the website. Some of these service providers can access some of the Log Data, but only to perform specific tasks for the purpose of providing the Services.

### Social Sharing Features

Our Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.

Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Services or through our partners becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. If you remove information that you posted to the Services or through our partners, copies may still remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Services or with our partners.

## How is Data Stored? <a name="howstored"></a>

Data is stored in servers in the United States of America.

When using our website, all data that is transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted (SSL), and all data you provide that is potentially identifiable is obfuscated and/or encrypted when stored.

Any communication you have with us will be stored in the medium and technology that it is sent. For example, if you send an email to us, then that email will be stored in our email system.

### Account Data

Passwords you enter are never stored directly. Instead, they are converted to a unique set of characters (called a "hash") that can be used in the future to verify the same password is entered, but cannot be used to determine the original password. The hash is additionally secured through encryption and other security processes such as using per entry salts and iteration counts.

Usernames and Email Addresses are stored encrypted and as encrypted hashes.

### Account Usage Data

Rating data, login times and signup times are stored in plain text.

### Log Data

Log data is stored as plain text logs.

### Data Security

We strive to implement and maintain reasonable, industry-standard secure storage technologies and commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, we cannot ensure or warrant 100% security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons or hardware or software failure. Further, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the information we have collected from you. 

Therefore if you create an account and therefore provide information such as your username, password and email address, it is recommended you choose a username that is not linked to your identity, a password that is randomly generated and managed by a password management system, and an email address that is not linked to your identity and is secured with a robust password and two-factor authentication.

This I Get will never send you an email asking for your password, or any personal information, and if you see any such thing then you should contact us at privacy@thisiget.com.

Should you notice any flaws or concerns in our security, please contact us at privacy@thisiget.com.

## Marketing <a name="marketing"></a>

This I Get will not send you marketing emails.
