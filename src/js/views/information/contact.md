### Single Page Content

Single page content can be completely written in Markdown. This is a format that looks very much like normal text, and because of its simplicity it has become a popular way of writing content throughout the web. You will not need any programming experience to contribute such content.

### Interactive Presentation Content

Interactive presentation style content does require the Javascript programming language. Therefore, it is useful to have either experince in at least some programming, even if it's in a different language. 

### Creation Process

To create content, it is useful to create a "test" or "development" web server that looks and feels like the real website, but is running on your local machine and updates its content in real time based on any additions or changes you make. 

Normally, this would require significant experience with software technologies to get going, but because this project is "containerized" using Docker (a popular containerizing software), then you should need only perform a small number of easy to follow steps to get this going.

Therefore I believe this should also not require any previous programming experience, and therefore someone should be able to contribute and test Single Page Content with no programming experience.

### Copyright

Similar to Wikipedia, any content you contribute will be licensed under the Creative Commons... Licence. Though the Copyright remains with the creator, this gives others the right to reuse the content with minimal restrictions.
