# Goal

Be as inclusive as possible.

# Learning
There are many ways to learn.

People’s individual experiences, knowledge, language, context and personality mean some ways work better for some people and other ways work better for others.

How the learning is to be applied also changes which way might be most effective. Sometimes practice is the most efficient or most appropriate way to learn, other times having a deep understanding is required.

Even time can play a role. As someone becomes a more experienced learner, their preference for how they learn may evolve.

Some examples of the different ways to learn include:

* by discovery - knowing about a problem, and being challenged to come up with a concept to understand it better, or a tool to solve it
* by explanation - a description of what and why something is
* by example - seeing when and how something is used
* by practice - using that thing repeatedly
* or by a combination of ways

Each of these ways can be delivered in different styles. For example an explanation might be:

* precise or intuitive
* brief or descriptive
* general or personalized
* or a combination of styles

And then there are different ways to participate in the learning, such as:

* in person
* or from media such as text and videos
* or as part of a group working toward a project or goal

So there are many ways to learn, and no one place or person can do everything for everyone.

In the end, learning is successful if you get what you need out of it.


# Our Contribution

There has never before been more resources and opportunities available for someone who wants to learn.

But as a learner, how do you decide where to spend time learning? Time is a finite resource. The more efficiently you learn, the sooner you can use those learnings.

As a teacher, how do you decide how to teach? What assumptions do you make about your learner? For whom do those assumptions not apply?

So instead of selecting a particular approach, this site tries to embrace many of the diverse possibilities. It does this through:

* Having multiple forms and versions of the same content
* Allowing users to rate which forms and versions of content work best for them
* Embracing external content and allowing users to rate it

In the short term, having multiple forms, versions and external links describing the same content in different ways will hopefully be a useful resource. Rating the content might be valuable to a learner so if they review it again, they know what they connected with best.

In the longer term as more content is rated, users may be able to get a more personalized and efficient experience by having content that is more likely to resonate with them presented first.

# Terminology

## Topic
A “Topic” is the site’s fundamental unit, and is a relatively contained piece of content. A topic’s required knowledge and desired learnings should be clearly defined.

An example of a topic might be “Isosceles Triangle”. This topic would require knowledge of triangles, and then present the definition and properties of an isosceles triangle.

## Learning Path:
A learning path is a set of topics that follow each other based on dependence.

At the start of the path (the first topic) a set of knowledge is assumed. But after that point, each topic covers all knowledge that future topics in the path will require.

## Form:
The content of each topic can be presented in one of several forms. The most common forms are:

* Discover - a problem statement is given with progressively more hints to allow the user to discover the content

* Explanation - a complete description of the content
* Summary - what you need to know to move onto the next topic
* Examples - Examples showing where and how to use the content
* Quiz - Practice using the content
* TA - Interactive diagrams that might be useful in a teaching environment
* Links - A selection of external links that also address the same content in different ways or from different perspectives

## Versions:
Each form might have several versions - describing the topic’s content in the same form, but in a different way. Some ways that might differentiate versions are:

* precise versus intuitive
* interactive versus static
* video versus text
* one way of presenting the content versus another (descriptive vs concise)
* different proofs of the same concept

## Rating:
Each version of content or link can be rated by a user between 1 and 5. The user can use their own judgement when rating content, but one way might be:
* 5 - The content really clicks with the user from start to finish
* 4 - The content is well done, but there a few areas that weren’t clear
* 3 - The content is good, but other versions of it needed to be reviewed to fully get it
* 2 - It is difficult to understand, and doesn’t really work for the user
* 1 - The content was not helpful

Ratings are personal. Some content will get a 5 from some users, and a 1 from other users. Even if content only gets high ratings from a small percentage of users, it is still valuable and appreciated. The fact it helped some people is fantastic, as other more popular versions of the content might not have been helpful for them.

Users can see two ratings for each version of content:
* Their own rating
* The number of people that gave a rating of 4 or 5

The intent here is to celebrate all lessons that help users, and not degrade from those that help only a smal percentage.

Whether this can be realized is not clear, and this will likely be experimented with over time.
